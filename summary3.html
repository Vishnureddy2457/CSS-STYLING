        <h2>Travis Head</h2>

        <p>
            Born: December 29, 1993 <br>
            Role: Left-hand bat, right-arm offspin <br>
            <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
            Now a very real option in the middle order in the 2019 Ashes series, Travis Head has long been a regular member of Australiaâ€™s white-ball squads after making his debut in 2016 as a 22-year-old.
            Highly rated from a young age, Head made his Sheffield Shield debut for South Australia at the age of 18 and made two fifties in his first four games for the state.
            Having established himself as a regular for his domestic side over the next few seasons, Head was made their youngest ever captain at 21 when awarded the role in 2015.
            Head emptly led his state to their first Shield final in over 20 years in his first season in charge and his white ball form earned him his ODI and T20I call-ups the next year.
            Since then, Head has scored 1,237 ODI runs and 319 T20I runs for his country and made his maiden ODI century against Pakistan at Adelaide. A useful part-time off spinner, Head lists the likes of Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor, Faf du Plessis and Babar Azam amongst his 13 international victims.
