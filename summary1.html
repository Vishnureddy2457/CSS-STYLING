        <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
        <p>Despite his debut for New South Wales in the 2010-11 season and a standout performance in his first Big Bash season, Cummins' promising career was put on hold. 
            Struggling with repeated stress fractures in his lower back, he was sidelined from Test cricket for an agonising six years.
             It wasn't until the 2017 tour of India that he made a thumping return.
            Cummins' resurgence coincided with a turbulent time in Australian cricket, marred by the infamous ball-tampering scandal. 
            During this period of upheaval, he emerged as a source of hope. 
            Though he missed the 2018 winter tours due to injury, his subsequent performances against India and Sri Lanka earned him the Test vice-captaincy.
            His relentless pace and stamina on the field led to his recognition as the world's No. 1 Test bowler and the recipient of the Allan Border Medal for the 2018-19 season. 
            His contributions were massive in the 2019 Ashes and the home series against India.
